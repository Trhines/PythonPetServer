# PythonPetServer
This was built to test a DB model for petMatch designed to have match data ready on command.
This is a proof of concept and will be expanded upon in the full website.
The idea is built around a dating app style "like" and "match" system.
A key problem with the original design was having the matches found by running an algorithm on call.
This design should have the match data ready before hand without the need of an algorithm, improving response times and user experience.
